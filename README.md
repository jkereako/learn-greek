# Notes on the language
- **The infinitive form does not exist**. When you read "to [verb]", it's
  actually the conjugation of first person singular in the present tense.

# The basics
I'm putting the basics here so they're easy to locate.

### Yes and no (ναί και όχι)

Yes and no in Greek are **ναί** and **όχι** respectively. A good but ironic way to remember them is ναί sounds like "no" and όχι sounds like "okay".

### Genders
Greek has 3 of them: feminine, masculine and neuteur. Worse, there are 3 grammatical cases for each.

#### Singular
|                 | Masculine | Feminine  | Neuter  |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| **Nominative**  | ο         | η         | το      |
| **Genitive**    | του       | της       | του     |
| **Accusative**  | τον       | την       | το      |

#### Plural
|                 | Masculine | Feminine  | Neuter  |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| **Nominative**  | οι        | οι        | τα      |
| **Genitive**    | των       | των       | των     |
| **Accusative**  | τους      | τις       | τα      |
